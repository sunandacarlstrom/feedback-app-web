This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Feedback App

Feedback App is a web application, primarily designed for tablets and mobile phones, which may be used at various events in order to receive and save feedback from visitors. An event within the application includes a quiz (questionnaire). Each quiz must consist of components where each component contains questions and answers such as labels and input fields. Several answers to the questions will consist of graphic elements such as buttons in the shape of smiley faces so that the visitor may easily give ratings. All data collection will be stored in a database.

The application's goal is to attract visitors to leave feedback directly when attending an event so that the company behind the event can then collect and analyze the feedback for future events.
